# Innovation Camp
Coding demo and challenge for the 2022 Innovation Camp

## Description
This repository was created for an interactive coding demo + exercise for the 2022 Innovation Camp Pilot. The purpose is to expose participants to different analytical, visualization, and collaborative techniques that are available in open source software such as Rmarkdown.

There are two versions of the coding challenge, one with examples and hints (challenge.Rmd) and the other a minimalist version for those looking to challenge themselves (challenge-no-hints.Rmd).

## Installation
If you are working in AAW, all packages are readily available to you. Otherwise, the following packages will need to be installed:

```
library(cansim) # read in CODR/NDM tables
library(dplyr) # for data manipulation
library(tidyr) # for shaping the data
library(plotly) # for creating plots
library(lubridate) # for manipulating date-time objects
```
## The Assignment
In this workshop we will be exploring [Stocks of specified dairy products](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3210000101#tables). 

We will learn and practice how to
    1. Load data
    2. Clean data
    3. Create a plot
